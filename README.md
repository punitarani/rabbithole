# üêá RabbitHole

RabbitHole is a cutting-edge tool designed to simplify and personalize the learning process. It leverages modern machine learning techniques to analyze a variety of document types, including text files, PDFs, images, and even videos, and distills these materials into key concepts and summaries.

The tool's robust algorithm determines the logical sequence of these concepts, creating a personalized study plan that guides learners from foundational knowledge to more complex ideas.

## How RabbitHole Works

At the heart of RabbitHole is a novel algorithm developed using Python and powered by HuggingFace's transformer models.

When a document is uploaded to RabbitHole, the algorithm begins by using embeddings to analyze the text and extract keywords and core concepts. These embeddings are capable of capturing semantic meaning and relationships between words, making them an effective tool for understanding the key points in a text.

Once the keywords and concepts have been identified, the algorithm then determines their logical sequence. It does this by understanding the dependencies between concepts, ensuring that foundational ideas are introduced first and more complex concepts are introduced as learners progress through their study plan.

## The Novel Algorithm

The novel algorithm developed for RabbitHole is a significant advancement in the field of personalized learning. It leverages state-of-the-art embeddings to accurately and quickly extract key concepts from large volumes of text.

This algorithm distinguishes itself through its ability to not only identify key concepts but also understand the relationships and dependencies between them. This allows it to create a logical sequence of concepts for the study plan, building from basic to more complex ideas.

By harnessing the power of these modern machine learning techniques, RabbitHole provides a personalized and efficient learning experience for users.
